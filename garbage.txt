1. Core DevOps & Platform Engineering Skills
Kubernetes (K8s)
Managing, upgrading, and automating deployments across multiple clusters and environments.

ArgoCD & GitOps
Git-based application delivery, environment-based syncing, Helm/manifest management.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Primarily Terraform, optionally Crossplane, for cloud provisioning.

Cloud Platforms (at least one)
‚úÖ AWS (preferred)
‚úÖ GCP / Azure also relevant
Strong understanding of EC2, IAM, VPC, EKS, S3, etc.

CI/CD Pipelines
Full pipeline design, build-test-deploy stages using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI.

üß† 2. SRE / System Reliability Concepts
SLI/SLOs, MTTR, high availability strategies
Focus on uptime, incident resolution, and service-level metrics.

Monitoring & Observability
Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Alertmanager, CloudWatch
Experience building alerts, custom dashboards, log aggregation, and tracing.

Incident Response & Root Cause Analysis
Real-world experience handling production outages or critical system failures.

üë®‚Äçüíª 3. Programming / Scripting
Golang (Mandatory)
Building platform tools, controllers, and automation scripts.

Shell scripting & Python (Bonus)
For task automation, log handling, and quick operational tooling.

üîê 4. Access & Security
IAM, SSO, and RBAC
Managing secure access across cloud and Kubernetes (e.g., via Keycloak, OIDC).

Secrets Management
Using K8s secrets, Vault, or cloud-native alternatives securely.

üîÑ 5. Soft Skills & Engineering Mindset
Collaboration & Communication
Cross-functional team alignment, async communication (remote-first setup).

Open Source Familiarity (Plus Point)
Contributions or usage of Kubernetes ecosystem tools (e.g., Cluster API, ArgoCD).

Growth & Initiative
Willingness to work on complex infrastructure at scale and contribute to internal tooling/platform design.
